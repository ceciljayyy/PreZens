Project Name: PreZens – A GPS-based Attendance Tracking Progressive Web App (PWA).

1. Overview
PreZens is an attendance tracking application designed for businesses, organizations, and schools. It enables users to check in using GPS-based validation, with biometric authentication and manual check-ins as backups. The app provides real-time attendance reporting via dashboards and notifications.

2. Key Features
GPS-Based Check-In: Users must be within a predefined location to check in.

Admin-Defined Meeting Locations:

Admins create meetings and define attendance zones using:

Manual Address Entry (converted to GPS coordinates via Google Maps API).

Map Selection (Admin clicks on a map to choose a location).

Current Location (Admin's current GPS location is saved).

Each meeting has:

Name

Date & Time

Allowed Check-In Radius (Configurable in meters)

Authentication:

Google Sign-In & Email/Password Login

Attendance Validation:

Primary: GPS location verification

Secondary: Biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition)

Backup: Manual check-in (requires admin approval)

User Roles & Dashboards:

Employee View: Check-in, history, notifications

Admin View: Attendance reports, user management, meeting creation

Real-Time Reporting & Notifications:

Attendance data is shown in dashboards, graphs, and tables.

Notifications for missed check-ins and late arrivals.

Check-In History: Users can view past check-ins.

PWA Functionality: Installable on devices for a native-like experience.

Location Permissions Handling:

Requests location access only once.

Stores permission status in localStorage to prevent repeated prompts.

Encourages users to select "Allow Always" for seamless check-ins.

3. Tech Stack
Frontend: React (TypeScript) with Material-UI (@mui)

Backend: Next.js (Node.js)

Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries

Geolocation API: Google Maps API for location processing

Deployment: PWA (no Play Store or APK distribution)

4. Functionality Breakdown
Admin Workflow:

Log in → Navigate to Dashboard.

Create a meeting → Set location via address, map, or current location.

Configure check-in radius → Save.

View attendance records in real-time.

Employee Workflow:

Open PreZens (PWA).

Click "Check-In".

If within the allowed GPS radius → Marked as "Present".

If outside the allowed radius → Check-in denied.

Attendance history updates.

5. Advanced Features (Future Considerations)
Slack Integration: Notifications for missed check-ins.

Offline Mode: Check-ins stored locally and synced when online.

QR Code Check-In: Admins generate QR codes for meeting locations.

Final Output: The AI should generate clean, scalable code following best practices, ensuring PreZens meets all the outlined requirements.
